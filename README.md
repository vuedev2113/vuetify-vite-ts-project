FOR EXPERIMENTAL.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Includes [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) [^1].

In addition, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are also included and are set to be executed automatically at runtime and commit. (Since these settings are set strictly, please relax yourself.)

Also, when the development server is executed, it is checked in real time by [vite-plugin-checker](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker).

### Composition API

It also supports the [Composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/). The installed VueRouter and Vuex are for Vue2, but you can use the functions (such as `useRouter()`, `useRoute()` and `useStore()`) for the composition API for Vue3.

It is possible to mix code written in composition-api and code written in vue-property-decolator, but it is not recommended to use them together in the same component. [^1]

As a limitation, Vue2's composition api cannot monitor the router with the watch function. In that case, monitor it by the following normal method:

```js
watch: {
  $route: {
    handler(to) {
      //
    },
    immediate: true,
  },
},
```

If you are thinking of supporting Vue2 and Vue3 both, consider introducing [vue-demi](https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi).

### Vue i18n

If you want to use [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/), please install [vue-i18n-composable](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-composable) and call the instance with `useI18n()`.

In addition, the conventional method using `$t()` written in non composition-api can be used as it is.

### Teleport

Vue3 adds a mechanism called [`Teleport`](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/teleport.html), which allows you to install vue components anywhere. This starter template is for vue2, but you can do the same with [vue2-teleport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue2-teleport).

However, you will need to manually load the component with `import Teleport from 'vue2-teleport';` wherever you want to use it.

#### Teleport JSON-LD Example

If you want to include [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), enter as follows.

```vue
<template>
  <div class="container">
    ... Some Content
    <teleport to="head">
      <component :is="'script'" type="application/ld+json" v-text="jsonLd" />
    </teleport>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { defineComponent } from '@vue/composition-api';

import Teleport from 'vue2-teleport';

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    Teleport,
  },
  setup() {
    const jsonLd = ref(
      JSON.stringfy({
        '@schema': 'https://json.schemastore.org/jsonld.json',
        '@context': 'http://schema.org',
        '@type': 'WebSite',
        name: 'Vite Vue2 TypeScript Startar',
        url: 'https://github.com/logue/vite-vue2-ts-starter',
        description: 'Vite Vue2 TypeScript Demo Page',
      })
    );

    return {
      jsonLd,
    };
  },
});
</script>
```

JSON-LD is literally a `script`, so it can't be embedded directly, so it's a roundabout thing like this, but simple things like `meta` tags are reflected by simply inserting a tag.

Notice: For Vue3, `:as="'script'"` becomes `is="script"`.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.

[^1]: [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) is the recommended state management library to replace [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) in the next Vue. see <https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/270#discussioncomment-2066856>

## Troubleshooting

When adding or deleting files, an error may occur and even if the error is corrected, it may not be reflected in devserver. In that case, stop devserver and delete all the files in the `node_modules/.vite` directory. You can also run it with the `clean` command.

Due to [yarn issues](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/4448), it may not work properly if the path contains non-ASCII characters (such as 日本語 or 한국어, 中文 etc.).
